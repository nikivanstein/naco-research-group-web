    <h2>Event partnerships</h2>
    The Natural Computing Cluster is an academic partner of the <a href="https://ecta.scitevents.org/CallForPapers.aspx" target="_blank">International Conference on Evolutionary Computation Theory and Applications (ECTA)</a>. 
    This conference intends to be a major forum for scientists, engineers and practitioners interested in the study, analysis, design, modeling and implementation of evolvable systems, both theoretically and in a broad range of application fields. ECTA welcomes both theoretical research and practical applications.
The conference also aims to foster hybrid approaches within evolutionary computation and also involving fuzzy computation and neural computation.
