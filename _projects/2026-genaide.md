The GenAIDE project is an Industrial Doctoral Network under the Horizon Europe Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) with 16 partners from 8 countries that focuses on human-AI teams in industrial design engineering. By developing CAE tools into AI partners that can interact with human designers and engineers, the project will enhance the productivity and creativity of design teams, particularly in the automotive and manufacturing industries. GenAIDE brings together a team of experts from academia and industry to provide a comprehensive training program that covers the technical, social, and ethical aspects of human-AI collaboration in design engineering. By training a new generation of researchers and engineers in the development and application of AI in industrial design, GenAIDE will drive innovation and competitiveness in the European industry, and pave the way for a future where human-AI teams can collaborate effectively to solve complex design challenges.
