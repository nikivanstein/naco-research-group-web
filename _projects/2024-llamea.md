LLaMEA, or Large Language Model Evolutionary Algorithm, is an innovative framework developed by the XAI research group at NACO. It leverages large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, to automate the generation and refinement of metaheuristic optimization algorithms. By iteratively evolving algorithms based on performance metrics and runtime evaluations, LLaMEA streamlines the optimization process without requiring extensive prior algorithmic knowledge. 

Key features of LLaMEA include:

- **Automated Algorithm Generation**: Utilizes GPT models to create and enhance algorithms automatically.

- **Performance Evaluation**: Integrates with the IOHexperimenter for real-time feedback, guiding the evolutionary process.

- **Customizable Evolution Strategies**: Allows configuration of strategies to effectively explore algorithmic design spaces.

- **Extensible and Modular Design**: Offers flexibility for users to incorporate other models and evaluation tools.

This framework is particularly beneficial for both research and practical applications in fields where optimization is crucial. For more details, including installation instructions and usage guidelines, please visit the project's [Github Repository](https://github.com/XAI-liacs/LLaMEA)
