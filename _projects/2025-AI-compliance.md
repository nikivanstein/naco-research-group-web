## Technical challenges of EU AI Act's requirements and their ethical implications.


This project explores the technical and ethical challenges of implementing the EU AI Act, focusing on translating its requirements into actionable technological solutions. It aims to develop algorithms and methodologies that ensure AI systems meet ethical and legal standards, assess risk levels and create best practices for compliance by design. By integrating insights from ethics, law and AI, the research contributes to advancing responsible AI development and aligns with the goals of the Ethics of Socially Disruptive Technologies (ESDT)[https://www.esdit.nl/] project which funds this research.
