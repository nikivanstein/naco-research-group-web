Conceptual vehicle design involves many engineering disciplines with coupled and oftentimes conflicting targets. Utilizing distributed algorithmic approaches for setting the design variables promises faster and better designs. The challenge is to handle coupling constraints between components and disciplines in a principled manner while preserving decision-making autonomy of each discipline. This research project seeks to enable distributed design optimization for practical use in multidisciplinary organizations. Areas of research include the development of a modular and easy-to-use software framework, acceleration of convergence and principled integration of generative artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the approach is evaluated on use-cases from automotive design.
