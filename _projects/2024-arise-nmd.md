## ARtificial Intelligence for the analySis of Electromyography for precision diagnosis of NeuroMuscular Diseases


Neuromuscular disorders, which affect millions of people in Europe alone, lead to (progressive) muscle weakness or sensory deficits that gravely affect life expectancy and quality of life. To diagnose the disorders, needle electromyography (nEMG) data must be assessed audio-visually by experts, which is subjective and time-consuming. In this project, experts in clinical neurophysiology, data science and instrumentation will develop an artificial-intelligence platform to automatically, objectively and accurately interpret nEMG data. They will validate the method using real nEMG data from around the world, and take first steps towards integrating the platform into existing software for clinical use.
