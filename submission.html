<h4>Submission</h4>
<p>This year, FOGA will use the "linklings" submission management system. This system is also used by GECCO, but note that a separate account will be required to submit papers to FOGA.</p>
<p>Link to the Linklings submission page: <a href="https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/FOGA">Linklings</a></p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> If you are developing an extended version of a recently accepted short paper (e.g. a GECCO poster), we recommend that you consider sending it to FOGA.</p>

<h4>ACM Publications Policy</h4>
<p>By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies" target="_blank">ACM Publications Policies</a>, 
    including ACM's new <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects" target="_blank">Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects</a>. 
    Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, 
    in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.
</p>

<p>
    Please ensure that you and your co-authors <a href="https://orcid.org/register" target="_blank">obtain an ORCID ID</a>, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper.  
    ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a <a href="https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs" target="_blank">commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors</a>. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.
</p>


<h4>Paper Format</h4>
<p>Authors should submit their papers consistent with the alternate 2-column ACM SIG style file "sigconf" by the submission deadline (<s>May 2</s> May 5, 2025). Authors are required to submit their 
    electronic papers in PDF format. The maximum number of pages is 12, including references. Over-length papers will be rejected without review. 
    Supplementary material is welcome but should not be essential to understand the paper.</p>
<p>The proceedings will be published by ACM Press. Instructions for the camera-ready papers will be made available in due time.</p>

<h4>Review Process</h4>
<p>The review process is double-blind. Authors must omit their names and affiliations from the paper and ensure their identity is not easily revealed. 
    Refer to prior work in a neutral manner. Reviewers should not reveal their identities within the paper reviews. 
    Selection criteria include originality of ideas, correctness, clarity, significance of results, and quality of presentation. 
    The review process will <strong>not</strong> include a rebuttal.</p>
<p>The decision of the Program Committee will be final and cannot be appealed.</p>
