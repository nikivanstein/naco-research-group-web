<h4>Submission</h4>
<p>This year, FOGA will use the "linklings" submission management system. This system is also used by GECCO, but note that a separate account will be required to submit papers to FOGA.</p>
<p>Link to the Linklings submission page: <a href="https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/FOGA">Linklings</a></p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> If you are developing an extended version of a recently accepted short paper (e.g. a GECCO poster), we recommend that you consider sending it to FOGA.</p>

<h4>ACM Publications Policy</h4>
<p>By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies" target="_blank">ACM Publications Policies</a>, 
    including ACM's new <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects" target="_blank">Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects</a>. 
    Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, 
    in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.
</p>

<p>
    Please ensure that you and your co-authors <a href="https://orcid.org/register" target="_blank">obtain an ORCID ID</a>, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper.  
    ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a <a href="https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs" target="_blank">commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors</a>. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.

    electronic papers in PDF format. The maximum number of pages is 12, including references. Over-length papers will be rejected without review.
