## BEComLLM: Bridging Evolutionary Computing and Large Language Models

The BEComLLM workshop seeks to uncover the possibilities of integrating LLMs with EC to push the boundaries of AI, machine learning, and optimization. Our goal is to foster collaboration among researchers and practitioners to:

- **Leverage LLMs in EC** for creating adaptive, scalable algorithms.
- **Advance the fields of LLMs and EC** through hybridization.
- **Facilitate knowledge-sharing** on the synergies and functions of these technologies, broadening their potential impact.

### Topics of Interest

The intersection of LLMs and Evolutionary Computing brings forth various topics of interest, including but not limited to:

- **Evolutionary Prompt Engineering**: Using evolutionary algorithms to optimize prompts for LLM tasks like text generation, summarization, and question answering.
- **LLM-Guided Evolutionary Algorithms**: Employing LLMs within EC to guide search processes, provide domain knowledge, or generate candidate solutions.
- **Co-evolution of LLMs and EC Techniques**: Studying how LLMs and EC techniques can evolve together to tackle complex, multi-objective problems.
- **Benchmarking and Comparative Studies**: Evaluating LLM-augmented EC against traditional EC in diverse optimization domains.
- **LLMs for Automated Code Generation in EC**: Using LLMs to streamline EC code creation, reducing development time and enhancing adaptability.
- **Optimization of LLM Architectures**: Applying EC to refine LLM hyperparameters and architecture, optimizing task-specific performance.
- **Real-World Applications**: Showcasing LLM-EC hybrid approaches in engineering, healthcare, finance, and the creative industries.

### Why Attend?

- **Explore Emerging Research**: Engage with pioneering techniques combining LLMs and EC to push AI's boundaries.
- **Networking**: Connect with experts in both fields and form impactful collaborations.
