## Large Language Models for and with Evolutionary Computation

Large language models (LLMs), along with other foundational models in generative AI, have significantly changed the traditional expectations of artificial intelligence and machine learning systems. An LLM takes natural language text prompts as input and generates responses by matching patterns and completing sequences, providing output in natural language. In contrast, evolutionary computation (EC) is inspired by Neo-Darwinian evolution and focuses on black-box search and optimization. But what connects these two approaches?

One answer is evolutionary search heuristics (LLM with EC), with operators that use LLMs to fulfill their function. This hybridization turns the conventional paradigm that ECs use on its head, and in turn, sometimes yields high-performing and novel EC systems.

Another answer is using LLM for EC. LLMs may help researchers select feasible candidates from the pool of algorithms based on user-specified goals and provide a basic description of the methods or propose novel hybrid methods. Further, the models can help identify and describe distinct components suitable for adaptive enhancement or hybridization and provide a pseudo-code, implementation, and reasoning for the proposed methodology. Finally, LLMs have the potential to transform automated metaheuristic design and configuration by generating codes, iteratively improving the initially designed solutions or algorithm templates (with or without performance or other data-driven feedback), and even guiding implementations.

This workshop aims to encourage innovative approaches that leverage the strengths of LLMs and EC techniques, thus enabling the creation of more adaptive, efficient, and scalable algorithms by integrating evolutionary mechanisms with advanced LLM capabilities. Thanks to the collaborative platform for researchers and practitioners, the workshop may Inspire novel research directions that could reshape AI, specifically LLMs, and optimization fields through this hybridization and achieve a better understanding and explanation of how these two seemingly disparate fields are related and how knowledge of their functions and operations can be leveraged.
